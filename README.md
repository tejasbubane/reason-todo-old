# reason-todo

My first attempt at reason-react! :tada:

Based on [this tutorial](https://jaredforsyth.com/2017/07/05/a-reason-react-tutorial/)
with small additions of my own.

Run this project:

```
npm link bs-platform
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run webpack
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run webpack` step), open up the nested html files in `src/*` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
